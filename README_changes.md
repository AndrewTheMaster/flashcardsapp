# Changes Made to the Chinese Flashcards App

## Overview of Changes
This document summarizes all the enhancements made to support multiple exercises per word and to show validation information more clearly.

## 1. Cache System Improvements
- **Multiple Exercises Per Word**: Modified `ExerciseCacheService` to store arrays of exercises for each word instead of single exercises
- **Duplicate Detection**: Added logic to prevent storing duplicate exercises
- **Cycling Through Exercises**: Added functionality to cycle through all cached exercises for a word

## 2. Validation Information Display
- **Enhanced Validation UI**: Added progress bars and color-coded indicators for BERT validation results
- **Detailed Metrics**: Now displaying semantic score, distractor score, and overall confidence 
- **Source Information**: Added clear indication of exercise source (cached, server-generated, or fallback)

## 3. Server-Side Improvements
- **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced the validation logging on the server to provide more information
- **Model Used Tracking**: Added information about which LM Studio model was used to generate each exercise
- **Timeout Increased**: Doubled the timeout for LM Studio requests from 40 to 80 seconds

## 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Next Exercise Button**: Added dedicated button to cycle through different exercise variants
- **Count Indicator**: Added clear indicator showing which exercise variant is currently displayed
- **Pinyin and Translation**: Added display of pinyin and translation when available
- **Validation Visualization**: Added progress bars for all validation metrics

## 5. Error Handling
- **Better Fallback Information**: Added more detailed information when falling back to local generation
- **Source Tracking**: All generated exercises now include information about their source

## How to Use
1. Run the server using the new `run_with_validator.bat` script
2. Use the app as normal, but now you can:
   - See detailed validation information for each exercise
   - Cycle through multiple exercises for the same word using the "Next Variant" button
   - Get better insights into exercise generation quality
